summary: "The Arouca Platform is a project that aimed at visualize the health professionals' locations and identify regions with low rate of medical assistance. The Arouca Platform is a database that aggregates information about health professionals from Brazilian National Healthcare System, known as the Unified Health System (Portuguese: Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS). In this platform are available data from professional's historical educational. For instance, where the professional graduated and which city is working currently."

## Arouca Platform
<div style="text-align: justify">
The Arouca Platform aimed to visualize the health professionals' locations and identify regions with a low rate of medical assistance. The Arouca Platform is a database that aggregates information about health professionals from Brazilian National Healthcare System, known as the Unified Health System (Portuguese: Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS). In this platform are available data from professional's historical educational. For instance, where the professional graduated and which city is working currently.

## What did we do?

In this project, I developed an R package called `aRouca` to provide tools for data visualization, compute Empirical Bayes estimates for rates and build maps in an easy way for georeferenced data. This package was integrated into the Arouca Platform and helped the decision-maker to understand the origin-destiny patterns of the health professionals from SUS as well as identify regions with a low rate of medical assistance. 

## Awards

I developed a method that identifies the distance that a population should move to find a region with enough amount of health professionals that can support it. These results were part of my Master’s degree which it has received the award Incentive Award in Science and Technology for Health System (in Portuguese: Prêmio de Incentivo em Ciência e Tecnologia para SUS). Part of this work can be seen at http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/ct/premio/2013_premiados.php.
